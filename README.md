The XDU-Liyukou dataset covers an area of Liyukou, Huyi, Xi'an, Shannxi Province, which contains an HSI taken on April 06, 2023 and a RGB image captured on November 18, 2022. The RGB image is obtained by FILR DUO Rro R sensor and has a spatial size of 700Ã—350. The HSI was captured by Micro-Hyperspec sensor and covers a spectral range of 0.4-1.0 $\upmu$m with a total of 270 spectral bands. After removing the noise bands, a total of 194 spectral bands are utilized for CD. The dataset encompasses diverse scenes, including trees, roads, soil, and buildings, showcasing the dynamic changes of various ground objects such as farmlands and land covers.
