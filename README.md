# XDU-Liyukou Dataset
he **XDU-Liyukou dataset** is designed for **multimodal change detection**. It covers an area of Liyukou, Huyi, Xi'an, Shannxi Province. The dataset consists of a hyperspectral image (HSI) acquired on April 6, 2023, and an RGB image captured on November 18, 2022.

- **RGB image** : collected by the FILR DUO Pro R sensor, spatial size 700 × 350.

- **HSI** : collected by the Micro-Hyperspec sensor, spatial size 200 × 150, with 194 spectral bands spanning 0.4–1.0 um. After removing noisy bands, 194 effective bands are retained for change detection.

The dataset contains diverse scenes, including trees, roads, soil, and buildings.
The ground-truth map uses:

Green pixels → changed areas

Yellow pixels → unchanged areas

Blue pixels → regions with uncertain change status
